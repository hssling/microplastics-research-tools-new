SEARCH STRATEGY: POPULATION, INTERVENTION (EXPOSURE), COMPARISON, OUTCOME

POPULATION:
- Human populations of all ages, genders, and health statuses
- Including all demographics: pregnant women, children, adults, elderly
- No geographical restrictions
- Exclusion: Animal studies only (unless related to human translation)

INTERVENTION (EXPOSURE):
- Microplastics or nanoplastics exposure
- Any type of plastic polymer particles (<5mm in at least one dimension)
- Exposure route: Oral/ingestion, inhalation, dermal absorption, intravenous
- Exposure matrix: Food, water, air, consumer products, occupational
- Exposure duration: Any duration (acute, subacute, chronic)
- Dose range: Any concentration of MP exposure

COMPARISON:
- Non-exposed or low-exposed comparators
- Pre-intervention vs post-intervention
- Different exposure groups or controls
- Historical controls where appropriate

OUTCOMES:
PRIMARY OUTCOMES:
1. Reproductive health outcomes (fertility, pregnancy complications, fetal development)
2. Gastrointestinal health (inflammation, microbiome disturbances, digestive disorders)
3. Respiratory health (inflammation, fibrosis, asthma/wheezing)
4. Carcinogenic effects (cancer incidence, tumor formation)

SECONDARY OUTCOMES:
5. Endocrine disruption (hormone levels, thyroid function, metabolic disorders)
6. Cardiovascular effects (inflammation, oxidative stress, metabolic changes)
7. Neurological effects (behavioral changes, cognitive impairment)
8. Immunology (immune function, allergies, infection susceptibility)
9. Dermatological effects (skin irritation, allergic reactions)
10. Systemic inflammation markers (cytokine levels, CRP, interleukins)

SEARCH METHODS

ELECTRONIC SEARCHES

Databases to be searched:
1. PubMed/MEDLINE (1966 to present)

Search date from: Database inception to December 2025
Language: English only
Publication status: Original research: observational studies, clinical trials, laboratory studies

Search strategy sample for PubMed:
("microplastics" OR "microplastic*" OR "micro-plastic*" OR "plastic pollution" OR "nanoplastic*" OR "MPs" OR "micro-sized plastics") AND ("human*" OR "health*" OR "toxicity" OR "exposure" OR "effects" OR "disease" OR "disorder") NOT ("animal*"[Title/Abstract] AND "humanology"[mh:noexp])

Full search strategy available in Supplementary File A

===============================================================================

SELECTION CRITERIA/PROCESS

Study designs to be included:
- Experimental studies (in vivo, in vitro, ex vivo)
- Cohort studies (prospective, retrospective)
- Case-control studies
- Cross-sectional studies
- Case series (>10 cases)
- Field studies with human biomonitoring

Study designs to be excluded:
- Reviews without original data
- Case reports or series (<10 cases)
- Animal studies without clear human translation
- Ecological studies without individual-level data
- Modelling studies without empirical data

GEOGRAPHIC RESTRICTIONS: No restrictions
SETTING: All settings, operationalized as any exposure assessment setting
AGE RESTRICTIONS: All age groups
OTHER: None

SECONDS CREENER STANDARDS:
- Two reviewers screen independently
- Discordant resolutions by third reviewer
- Consensus meeting for complex cases

===============================================================================

DATA EXTRACTION PROCESS

Data will be extracted by two independent reviewers using a piloted and standardized extraction form based on Cochrane guidelines and systematic review best practices.

Variables to be extracted include:
- Study characteristics (study design, setting, population)
- Methods (study duration, sample size, power analysis)
- Participants (age, sex, demographic details, inclusion criteria)
- Exposures (quantity, duration, route, matrix, verification method)
- Outcomes (definition, measurement, timing, analysis method)
- Results (effect sizes, confidence intervals, statistical significance)
- Risk of bias assessment
- Other information (funding, conflicts of interest)

Data extraction form available in Supplementary File B

DISAGREEMENTS
Discrepancies between reviewers will be resolved through discussion or third-party arbitration. All resolutions will be documented.

TRAINING OF EXTRACTORS
All data extractors will receive training on the data extraction form, systematic review methods, and risk of bias assessment before beginning data extraction.

PILOT TESTING
The extraction form will be piloted on 10 studies to ensure reliability and consistency before full implementation.

===============================================================================

RISK OF BIAS ASSESSMENT

Risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool version 2 (RoB 2) for interventional studies and ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies. We will assess:

1. Bias arising from the randomization process
2. Bias due to deviations from intended interventions
3. Bias due to missing outcome data
4. Bias in measurement of the outcome
5. Bias in selection of the reported result

Risk of bias will be assessed by two independent reviewers, with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer.

===============================================================================

DATA SYNTHESIS

For quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis):
- Effect measures: Risk ratios for binary outcomes, mean differences or standardized mean differences for continuous outcomes
- Statistical heterogeneity assessment: I² statistic and Q test
- Fixed-effect or random-effects model based on heterogeneity
- Subgroup analyses: by MP type, exposure route, population characteristics
- Sensitivity analyses: by study quality, exclusion of outliers

For qualitative synthesis:
- Narrative synthesis of findings across studies
- Thematic analysis of common exposure pathways
- Assessment of evidence quality using GRADE approach

===============================================================================

META-BIASES
- Publication bias assessment: Funnel plots and Egger's test (if ≥10 studies)
- Small study effects assessment
- Selective outcome reporting assessment
- Gray literature bias assessment

===============================================================================

CONFIDENCE IN CUMULATIVE EVIDENCE
Overall quality of evidence will be assessed using the GRADE approach:
- High quality: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate
- Moderate quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact
- Low quality: Further research is very likely to have an important impact
- Very low quality: Any estimate of effect is very uncertain

===============================================================================

ANALYTICAL APPROACH
1. Conduct meta-analyses where appropriate (minimum 2 studies with similar outcomes)
2. Use random-effects models for meta-analyses
3. Assess and explore statistical heterogeneity
4. Perform subgroup analyses to explore sources of heterogeneity
5. Use appropriate statistical software (R, Stata, or RevMan)

===============================================================================

SUBGROUP ANALYSES
Planned subgroup analyses:
1. By microplastics type (PE, PP, PET, PVC, etc.)
2. By exposure route (oral, inhalation, dermal)
3. By exposure matrix (food, water, air, consumer products)
4. By population age group (children, adults, elderly)
5. By study design (experimental vs observational)
6. By geographic region (developed vs developing countries)

===============================================================================

CONFIDENCE INTERVALS
All point estimates will be reported with 95% confidence intervals.

===============================================================================
