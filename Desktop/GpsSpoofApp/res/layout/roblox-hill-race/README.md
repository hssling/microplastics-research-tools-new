## UI & Sound Integration

1. In Roblox Studio, add a LocalScript to `StarterPlayer > StarterPlayerScripts` or `StarterGui`.
2. Copy the contents of `src/StarterPlayer/StarterPlayerScripts/HillRaceUILocalScript.lua` into this LocalScript.
3. The script will automatically create a leaderboard UI and play sounds for treasure and power-up collection.
4. You can customize the UI appearance and sound asset IDs as desired.
5. For more polish, add additional ScreenGui elements or sound effects in Studio.
## Extra Features & Polish

- Leaderboard: Tracks and displays top players based on score.
- Power-ups: Randomly spawn on the hill, grant bonuses when collected.
- UI polish: Hooks for leaderboard and power-up notifications (implement with ScreenGui in Studio).
- Sound effects: Add sounds for collecting treasure and power-ups (add in Studio).

## Testing Checklist

1. Import all scripts and models as described above.
2. Start a test session in Roblox Studio (Play mode).
3. Verify:
	- Obstacles and power-ups spawn at intervals.
	- Players can move, jump, and collect treasures.
	- Collecting a treasure or power-up updates the leaderboard.
	- RemoteEvents fire and update as expected (check Output window for prints).
	- UI and sound feedback (if implemented in Studio) work correctly.
4. Test with multiple players (use Start Server/Player in Studio for multiplayer).
5. Fix any errors or missing features as needed.
